Employees\nwho apply for Sick Leave Pool benefits must also apply for FMLA\nLeave if they qualify for Serious Health Condition Leave or Family\nCare Leave. Any awarded Sick Leave Pool hours will run\nconcurrently with FMLA leave.\n3. Workers\u2019 Compensation Leave\n\nFMLA Leave will run concurrently with workers' compensation leave\nwhen the injury is one that qualifies as a Serious Health Condition\nunder the FMLA. An employee\u2019s workers compensation leave\nselection determines whether an employee on FMLA Leave that is\nalso receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits will be required to\nutilize accrued leave while taking FMLA. Though UTA may offer an\nemployee a light duty position under workers\u2019 compensation rules,\nthe FMLA does not require the employee to accept the light duty\nposition, and the employee may decline the position and continue\nFMLA Leave until they are able to return to work. However, the\nemployee\u2019s failure to accept the light duty position may affect their\neligibility to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\n4. Injury Leave for Police Officers\n\nFMLA Leave will run concurrently with injury leave when the injury is\none that meets the criteria for a Serious Health Condition under the\nFMLA. An employee receiving injury leave benefits authorized by UT\nSystem Policy UTS 185 Injury Leave for Peace Officers will not be\nrequired to utilize accrued leave while taking FMLA Leave.\n5.

If the need for leave is unforeseeable, s, such as\npremature birth or medical illness, the notice should be given as soon\nas practical within one or two business days of when the employee\nlearns of the need for leave.\n2. Employees are required to complete a UTA Form DF-HR-LA-F-03\nRequest for Family and Medical Leave Form as provided by the\nOffice of Human Resources and provide the appropriate medical\ncertification as indicated on the form.\n3. An employee shall provide sufficient notice to make the University\naware that the employee needs FMLA leave, and the anticipated\ntiming and duration of the leave. The employee need not expressly\nassert rights under FMLA or even mention FMLA, but may only state\nthat leave is needed for an expected birth or adoption, for example.\n4. The University should inquire further of the employee if it is\nnecessary to have more information about whether FMLA leave is\nbeing sought by the employee, and obtain the necessary details for\nthe leave to be taken.\n5. An employee who has given notice under FMLA and has provided\nthe certification requirements, if needed, may not be denied family\nleave.\nD.
